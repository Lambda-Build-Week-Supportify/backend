# Supportify

*Introduction*

Connects users, schools and issues together

https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6222631/SW7Z49AQ?version=latest

## Overview
Hit the endpoints below with axiosWithAuth() to retrieve data. I'll let you know which fields are required in order to get a successful response. (note: this document will be evolving, check back regularly);

## Authentication
Front end will use axiosWithAuth and grab a token generated by the back end.

## Error Codes
What errors and status codes can a user expect?

`Anything between 200 and 299 signifies success. Usualy it will be 200 or 201. `

`200 means that you got back existing information that you requested from the server/database`

`201 means that you've successfully made a post request and created something new.`

`Anything between 400-499 is an error. Usually you will get back either 400 or 401 in the case of an error.`

`400 Bad Request response status code indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).`

`401 The HTTP 401 Unauthorized client error status response code indicates that the request has not been applied because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the target resource.`

`500 this status probably means there's something wrong with our backend logic.`

## [DEL] delete a school

### Example Request

users-schools

## [GET] get all schools and their users

`https://supportifyafrica.herokuapp.com/api/users-schools/all`

This request sends back all schools and any users attached to the schools. Each school-user relationship is it's own object, therefore, you will see an array of objects in which any individual school's information is repeated in multiple objects for as many times as there are users attachd to the school. Each time you see a school's information repeted in the array, the user information should be different.

### Example:

[

{
    "school_id": 2,
    "school_name": "Bayside High",
    "school_city": "Bayside",
    "school_state": "CA",
    "user_id": 2,
    "first_name": "Ted",
    "last_name": "Logan",
    "email": "ted@school.com",
    "board": false,
    "primary_admin": false,
    "sec_admin": false
},

{
    "school_id": 2,
    "school_name": "Bayside High",
    "school_city": "Bayside",
    "school_state": "CA",
    "user_id": 3,
    "first_name": "Sally",
    "last_name": "Logan",
    "email": "sally@school.com",
    "board": true,
    "primary_admin": false,
    "sec_admin": false
},
]



### Example Request

get all schools and their users
curl --location --request GET "https://supportifyafrica.herokuapp.com/api/users-schools/all"

## [GET] get a school's users

`https://supportifyafrica.herokuapp.com/api/users-schools/school/2`

Pass in an id parameter to the url and you'll get back an array of objects, all objects containing the same school information for the specified school, but with different user information in each object.



### Example Request

get a school's users
curl --location --request GET "https://supportifyafrica.herokuapp.com/api/users-schools/school/2"

## [GET] get a user's schools

`https://supportifyafrica.herokuapp.com/api/users-schools/user/3`

You guesed it, pretty much just like getting a school's users, except this time the last section if the url is /users/:id and you supply the user id to see all the schools the user is attached to.



### Example Request

get a user's schools
curl --location --request GET "https://supportifyafrica.herokuapp.com/api/users-schools/user/3"

## [POST] connect user to a school

`https://supportifyafrica.herokuapp.com/api/users-schools/connect-user`

*HEADERS*

	"school_id": 3
}


### Example Request

connect user to a school
curl --location --request POST "https://supportifyafrica.herokuapp.com/api/users-schools/connect-user" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data "{
	\"user_id\": 3,
	\"school_id\": 3
}"

## [DEL] remove a user from a school

`https://supportifyafrica.herokuapp.com/api/users-schools/disconnect`

In the body of the request pass in object like {"user_id":3,"school_id": 8} (order does not matter) to delete a user-school relationship.

!NOTE this does not delete the user object, the school object or any of their information. It ONLY deletes the relationship between the user and the school.

Upon successful deletion of a relationship, you'll recieve a 1 back in the response, 0 if failed.

*HEADERS*
Content-Typeapplication/json
BODY raw
{
	"user_id": 3,
	"school_id": 3
